# Changes

## 0.5

 - Change version naming convention from `major.minor.patch` to `major.minor.commit-count`.
 - Support clojurescript
 - Maven artifact group name changed from `robertluo` to `io.github.robertluo`.
 
## 0.4

 - Introduce `robertluo.pull/pull` function to pull information.

## 0.3

 - `fw` macro now is more flexible, you can use `:wrappers` to specify underlying wrapper implementations.
 - optional spec checker with `:spec` specify the return value's spec. Will check if it conform the spec.
 - optional parallel execution with `:par? true` specified in `fw` and with [manifold](https://github.com/ztellman/manifold) in your project's dependencies.
 - `print-method` for better developing experience. When you print the content of a fun map, the wrapped function will not be invoked. You can use `(into {} m)` to print everything inside it though.
 - introduce `lookup` function allowing transform any function as a part of the map.

## Breakings

> Breaking change since 0.1.x: normal function inside fun-map with `:wrap true` is not supported now, use `fw` macro instead.

> Breaking change since 0.2.x: function wrapper does not extend `IFn` anymore since it brings too much implementation burden for nested wrappers.
